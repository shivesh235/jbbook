### **Suggestions for Improvements:**

1. **Clarity and Conciseness:** Refine your personal introduction to make it direct and impactful. Highlight key skills and research areas succinctly.
2. **Consistency in Design:** Use consistent icon sizes for the contact section (email, LinkedIn, GitHub) to improve visual balance.
3. **Text Alignment:** Center-align key titles (e.g., your name, role) to make them stand out more prominently.
4. **Core Expertise Section:** Separate technical skills and experience to emphasize your abilities.
5. **Use of Professional Language:** The wording is more formal and focused on outcomes, which aligns with professional norms.
6. **Call-to-Action:** Direct users to explore your projects and experiences with a clear link, making navigation smoother.

This updated structure provides a clean, professional, and visually balanced presentation. You can further customize it by adding links to project sections and embedding interactive notebooks.
